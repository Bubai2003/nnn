        Dantès reappears nine years later, in 1838, as the mysterious, fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo. Mondego is now the Count de Morcerf, Danglars a baron and banker, and Villefort a procureur du roi (prosecutor for the king).

In Rome, at Carnival time, Dantès arranges for Viscount Albert de Morcerf, the son of Mercédès and Mondego, to be captured by the bandit Luigi Vampa. Dantès "rescues" the boy, who introduces the Count to Parisian society. Dantès dazzles Danglars with his wealth, persuading him to extend him a credit of six million francs (approximately €100,000,000 now). Dantès meets Mercédès for the first time in 23 years; she is oddly struck by seeing him.


Actor James O'Neill as the Abbé Busoni
Dantès purchases a home in Auteuil, a quarter of Paris. When his servant, a Corsican called Bertuccio, becomes nervous at the house, Dantès makes him explain why. Bertuccio reveals he had an older brother who raised him after they became orphaned. Bertuccio's brother was ambushed and killed in 1815 in Nîmes, where Villefort presided. His brother's death left him and his brother's widow, Assunta, destitute, which forced him to take up smuggling. Bertuccio demanded Villefort prosecute the killers, but he refused. When Bertuccio threatened Villefort, the latter asked to be transferred.

Bertuccio tracked Villefort to Auteuil, eventually finding him in late September 1815, the day when Madame Danglars, then a widow, delivered their illegitimate child in the house that the Count later purchased from Villefort's father-in-law. To cover up the affair, Villefort told Madame Danglars that the infant was stillborn, smothered the child and buried him in a box with a piece of linen cloth—which revealed his noble descent—(inscribed with the letters "H" and "N", later revealed as indicating Hermine of Norgonne) in the garden. During the secret burial, Bertuccio stabbed Villefort, unearthed the child and resuscitated him after fleeing. He left the child at a Paris asylum. After recovering from his wound, Villefort was ordered to the South. Later, Villefort tracked the baby to the asylum where Bertuccio had left him, but was told that a woman (Assunta) in possession of half of the linen cloth had taken the baby away.

Assunta raised the child, naming him Benedetto, but the boy took up a life of crime by age 11. One day, after Assunta refused to give him money, Benedetto and two comrades tortured her, and she died from her wounds.

Bertuccio stops at Caderousse's lodging, seeking shelter. Inside, he sees Caderousse negotiating with a jeweler for the sale of the diamond given to him by Dantès. The jeweler is forced to stay the night due to a storm. That night, Caderousse kills his wife and the jeweler, then flees with both the diamond and the money. Bertuccio enters the house, but is discovered by the authorities and arrested for the murders. While in jail, Bertuccio reveals the truth to Abbé Busoni, who confirms his story. Shortly before the start of the trial, Caderousse is captured and repatriated to France, where he confesses, which leads to Bertuccio's release. He takes Abbé Busoni's advice to work for the Count.

Benedetto is sentenced to the galleys with Caderousse. After the pair are freed by Dantès, using the alias "Lord Wilmore", the Count induces Benedetto to take the identity of "Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti" and introduces him to Parisian society. Andrea ingratiates himself to Danglars, who betroths his daughter Eugénie to him, not knowing they are half-siblings, after canceling her engagement to Albert. Meanwhile, Caderousse blackmails Andrea, threatening to reveal his past if he does not share his newfound wealth. Cornered by Abbé Busoni while attempting to rob the Count's house, Caderousse begs to be given another chance. Dantès forces him to write a letter to Danglars, exposing Cavalcanti as an impostor. When Caderousse leaves the estate, he is stabbed by Andrea. Caderousse dictates a deathbed statement naming his killer, and the Count reveals his true identity to Caderousse before he dies.

The Count has published in a French newspaper how Albert's father made his fortune in Greece: by the betrayal and murder of his employer, Ali Pasha. Fernand stole Ali Pasha's fortune and sold Ali's wife Vasiliki and four-year-old daughter Haydée into slavery. Dantès purchased Haydée when she was 13. Albert blames the Count for his father's downfall and challenges him to a duel. Mercédès, having recognized Monte Cristo as Dantès, begs him to spare her son. She learns the injustices inflicted on him, but convinces him to not kill her son. Realizing that Dantès intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, which causes him to make a public apology to the Count. Albert and Mercédès disown Fernand, renounce their titles and wealth and depart to begin new lives. Albert enlists as a soldier. Fernand confronts the Count of Monte Cristo, who reveals his identity. Fernand shoots himself.

Valentine, Villefort's daughter by his first wife, stands to inherit the fortunes of her grandfather Noirtier and her mother's parents, the Saint-Mérans, while Villefort's second wife Héloïse seeks the fortune for her son Édouard. The Count is aware of Héloïse's intentions and introduces her to the techniques of poison. Héloïse poisons the Saint-Mérans, and Valentine inherits their fortune. Valentine is briefly disinherited by Noirtier in an attempt to prevent Valentine's impending marriage to Franz d'Épinay, whom she does not love; the marriage is canceled when d'Épinay learns from Noirtier that his father, whom he believed was assassinated by Bonapartists, was killed by Noirtier in a duel.

After a failed attempt on Noirtier's life, which leaves Noirtier's servant Barrois dead, Héloïse targets Valentine so that Édouard will get the fortune. However, Valentine is the prime suspect in her father's eyes in the deaths of the Saint-Mérans and Barrois. On learning that Morrel's son Maximilien is in love with Valentine, the Count saves her by making it appear as though Héloïse's plan to poison Valentine has succeeded. Villefort, learning from Noirtier that Héloïse is the real murderer, gives her the choice of public execution or committing suicide.

Fleeing after Caderousse's letter exposes him, Andrea is arrested and returned to Paris. Eugènie Danglars flees as well, with her girlfriend. Villefort prosecutes Andrea. Bertuccio tells Andrea, in prison, who his father is. At his trial, Andrea reveals that he is Villefort's son and was rescued after Villefort buried him alive. Villefort admits his guilt and rushes home to prevent his wife's suicide but is too late; she is dead and has poisoned her son as well. The Count confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity, which drives Villefort insane. Dantès tries but fails to resuscitate Édouard, causing him to question if his revenge has gone too far.

For his final revenge, the Count bribes a telegrapher to send a fake telegram to the Ministry of Interior stating that the pretender to the Spanish throne has returned to Barcelona to popular acclaim. This news devalues Spanish bonds in which Danglars had invested six million francs. However, after the news is proved false, Danglars ends up losing 700,000 francs, and then, another 8–900,000 after a man called Jacopo Manfredi, secretly the Count's accomplice, mysteriously goes bankrupt and fails to fulfill his obligations. Eventually, through further manipulation of the market, Danglars is left with a ruined reputation and 5,000,000 francs he has been holding in deposit for hospitals. The Count demands this sum to fulfill their credit agreement, and Danglars embezzles the hospital fund. He flees to Italy with the Count's receipt for the cash he requested from the banker Danglars, and 50,000 francs. While leaving Rome, he is kidnapped by Luigi Vampa. Forced to pay exorbitant prices for food and water, Danglars pays with his ill-gotten gains. Dantès anonymously returns the money to the hospitals, as Danglars had given their money to the Count. Danglars finally repents his crimes, and a softened Dantès forgives him and allows him to depart with his 50,000 francs.
